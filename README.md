## Background

# Why did you want to make this app? 

Inspired by a passion for compelling information presentation and the enormity of the Twitter dataset, we set out to bring people closer through our code. For the sake of limiting our project scope, we chose to focus on increasing ambient awareness in New York City by displaying live-streamed, local tweets in three different ways.

## Features

HivePulse

Using geolocation data provided by Twitter and Google Maps API, HivePulse displays the heartbeat of the city on a heat map overlay. We chose this visualization in part because Twitter's dataset provides uniquely comprehensive geolocation tagging: 

<--! #not sure if we want to use this but it's cool and everyone should read it!

"Twitter presents a truly unique opportunity to measure the accuracy of the geocoding process in a far more comprehensive and quantitative fashion. Unlike any other major document collection available for academic research, Twitter contains a sensor–based gold standard in which 2.6 percent of the data is assigned a precise physically–measured location that can be compared with the geocoded results to determine their correlation. Even more significant is the size of the data samples: more than 30 million tweets georeferenced via sensor as a gold standard and a total of 1.5 billion tweets containing 14.3 billion words as the collection to geocode." -->
