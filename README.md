# Twitterapp

## Description

Twizardry is a Rails application that streams and visualizes Twitter data to help you get in touch with New York City.

## Background

# Why did you want to make this app? 

Inspired by a passion for compelling information presentation and the enormity of the Twitter dataset, we set out to bring people closer through our code. For the sake of limiting our project scope, we chose to focus on increasing ambient awareness in New York City by displaying live-streamed, local tweets in three different ways.

## Features

HivePulse

Using geolocation data provided by Twitter and Google Maps API, HivePulse displays the heartbeat of the city on a heat map overlay. We chose this visualization in part because Twitter's dataset provides uniquely comprehensive geolocation tagging.
